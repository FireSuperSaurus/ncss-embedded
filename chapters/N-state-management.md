## Program state

Many of the programs we've written so far are *stateless* which means that the program acts only on its current input.

As the programs get more sophisticated they need to remember more *state*, allowing them to use past inputs to make decisions.

Some examples:

* Remembering a count of the number of times an event has happened.
* Keeping track of a mode (e.g. waiting for player, playing, showing score, etc).
* Tracking a position in a sequence (i.e. entering a specific button sequence).
