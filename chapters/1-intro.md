## Chapter 1 -- Intro to embedded

Electronic devices are everywhere in modern life. From light bulbs to toasters to computers and cellphones, we rely on the principles of electronics to survive in modern society. As technology develops, perhaps the more surprising development is that even seemingly simple tools are no longer just simple electronic devices, but rather are becoming embedded devices, incorporating small microcontrollers to make them operate in increasingly smart ways. A *simple* light bulb is no longer just a wire that glows, it's a complicated circuit that includes a computer to monitor the brightness and power consumption of the light. Toasters and kettles contain little microcontrollers to allow fine adjustment of temperature and cooking time. Even a phone or a laptop charger contains a little computer to ensure safe charging of your device and to improve the efficiency with which it can operate. And this is **WAY** before we even start to consider the proliferation of internet enabled devices that are permeating our households.

So what is an *embedded device*? It's a small, programmable computer, tightly integrated with a set of sensors and mechanical parts to enable it to perform a specific task. As electronics has become smaller, cheaper and more efficient, we've been able to put them into an ever increasing number of places, and to do ever more complicated tasks with them.

And this is exactly what the focus of this course is going to be! Learning how to design simple electronic devices to perform some specific task of choice. Since we are talking about embedded design, the course focusses not just on software development, but includes a certain amount of electronics as well. We don't want to get stuck in the land of pure software work, an embedded engineer is often plugging and unplugging, working with motors, sensors, lights and speakers to make devices that interact with the real world. Of course, this also brings along with it a measure of pain.... Over the course of the coming days you will deal not only with buggy code, but faulty wiring and the crazy interaction between the messy real world and the devices you are making.

But ultimately, that's why we love embedded development so much. As painful as it is to deal with the real world, making devices that we can touch, see and hear, whether it's for a specific purpose, or art, or fun, brings along with it a huge amount of satisfaction. We're super excited to get started!

### The Project

By the end of the camp, you and a group of 3/4 other team members will have developed:

- a simple game that uses a small microcontroller, a host of sensors and various outputs
- a 3-5 minute video that introduces your game and your team, and goes through the process of developing your final project.

In order to successfully accomplish these tasks you will learn not only about programming and electronics, but about how to work together as a group to juggle completing the various tasks before the deadline on Saturday night. Just like a real project there are a lot of things to learn, tight deadlines and limited resources (you can't hire more people ðŸ˜›). You'll learn about the techniques that real tech companies use to manage teams, and by the end, have taken a project from idea to realization. One of the most important lessons to learn over the course of the camp is that engineering real products is not a solo effort, but will require you to work with others to optimally utilize the talents and skills of everyone in your group, and that effective team management plays as much of a role in making something as being a boss coder.

As the course progresses, you will get more information about exactly what sort of game you will be working on.

### Too Much Information!!!

Given the amount of material that we need to cover in a very limited amount of time, the academic portion of the camp is going to be quite jam packed. There will be two 30-minute-to-1-hour lectures per day, as well as two 3-hour lab sessions to put theory into practice. Since there is so much to cover, the lectures will move through the content quite quickly, however this year, we are also going to have some in-lab lectures that will go through some of the key concepts in a bit more detail.

In addition to this, this booklet serves as both a reference for the material covered during the lectures, and a source of additional information. If you want to double check something that was previously covered, it should be available in this book.

Don't be concerned if you don't understand everything in the lectures or labs first time around. Everything progresses at an incredibly fast pace. If you do get stuck, ask one of the lecturers (Jim, Owen, Seb and Joel), or one of the many tutors for help.

**The only silly question, is the one that doesn't get asked!**

Chances are, if you have a question, you're not the only one in the room who has the same issue. The tutors are very happy to help, and the lecturers are more than happy to go through things in more detail, but we can only go through things in detail if you ask us questions! Not only are we here to help you understand concepts, but we are also more than happy to help you find tricky bugs in your program, or figure out wiring issues in your bots. Feel free to talk to us about what being at university is like, how we like Computer Science as a subject, and how we ended up in computing. We'll be here all week!

Finally, don't forget to experiment. One of the best things about embedded is that you can wire things up and see how they react in the real world. Although parts of the course are online, the joy of embedded is in seeing lights flash, motors spin and speakers beep. Feel free to grab anything from the drawers over the course of the week and play around with them. If you want help getting something to work ask.
