Booklet (lectures, lab notes, samples and demos) for NCSS Embedded stream

## Authoring

### Equations
Use [Math URL](http://mathurl.com/) to generate a PNG, and then embed using Markdown:

```
![Taylor Series](http://mathurl.com/yaay9fvf.png)
```

You can edit the equation (and generate a new URL) by removing the `.png` from the URL.

### Code snippets
Use regular markdown code blocks, with the `python` language set. e.g.

````
```python
from microbit import *
display.show(Image.HEART)
```
````

## Printing
